# Security Vulnerability Resolution Plan

This document outlines the plan to resolve the security vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`.

## Problem

`npm audit` reports moderate vulnerabilities in `hono` and `lodash`, which are transitive dependencies of `prisma`. The project is already on the latest version of `prisma` (7.4.0), making an upgrade impossible. The `npm audit fix --force` command suggests a dangerous downgrade of `prisma` and will not be used.

## Proposed Solution: `npm overrides`

The plan is to use the `overrides` feature in `package.json` to force `npm` to use secure versions of the vulnerable packages without altering the `prisma` dependency itself.

### Steps:

1.  **Identify Secure Versions:**
    *   Find the latest, secure version of `hono` (vulnerable: `<=4.11.6`).
    *   Find the latest, secure version of `lodash` (vulnerable: `4.0.0 - 4.17.21`).
    *   This will be done using the `npm view <package> version` command.

2.  **Update `package.json`:**
    *   Add an `overrides` section to `package.json`.
    *   Specify the new, secure versions for `hono` and `lodash`.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Run `npm install` to apply the overrides.

4.  **Verify the Fix:**
    *   Run `npm audit` one more time to confirm the vulnerabilities have been resolved.

5.  **Update Progress Log:**
    *   Document all steps and their outcomes in the `HEALTH_CHECK_REPORT.md` file.

This is the safest method to resolve these specific issues.

Update this plan before making any changes to keep a track of items that are already done and which are pending to avoid rework
